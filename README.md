### Thoughts:
> Fun project i made for freecodecamp.com. It was my first project using the React library. 
I've been learning react for the past few months and i wanted to practice using Hooks
so i made the entire application using only function components. I Love react, i feel like i can understand it
pretty well and can't wait to start even better projects.
